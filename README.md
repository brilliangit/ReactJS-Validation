## Elegant Form Validation Using React Demo ##

This project is a demonstration of a simple approach of form validation in React apps.

For an explanation of the approach see [Elegant Form Validation Using React](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/10/05/form-validation-react/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


### Installing dependencies ###
`yarn install`
or
`npm install`

### Running The App ###
`yarn start`
or
`npm run start`

The app will launch and be served at `http://localhost:3000/`.
Initially validation errors will be hidden. Click _Create Account_ to begin showing validation errors. Errors will then be "live". Refresh the page to start over.
